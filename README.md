# Batch-Scheduling-Simulator-
This is a batch scheduling simulator written in C. It simulates the performance of three different batch scheduling algorithms:  FIFO (First-In-First-Out), SJF (Shortest Job First), and SRT (Shortest Remaining Time). Additionally, it includes an interactive  processing algorithm called Round Robin.
